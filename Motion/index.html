	<h1>The Beauty of Music</h1>
	<h2>Beauty and curiousity are the hand maidens of the mind!</h2>

		<p>
		Why is music beautiful to me?</p>
		<p>
		How does my mind organize the sounds into an 
		emotioanl and intellecual response?</p>
		<p>
		The interplay of musical logic and emotions in this abstract dimension has
		always been a mystery to me.</p>

		<p> I have a multitude of questions with no answers.</p>
		<p>Do I really need answers when I listen to Mozart, Cole Porter, Stravinsky
		and Duke Ellington?</p>

		<p>Enjoy and marvel at the miracle of the experience.</p>
		<p>A beauiful sunset is both a simultaneous question and answer and, truly,
		inseparable.</p>

		<p>Here is a great book to read, Sound in Motion by David Mcgill.</p>

		<p>The whole universe is in motion.</p>
